Week 1

This week I used AI to the minimum since we practiced basic pyhton skills which we should 
know as students but i found that for when i asked for examples on certains areas like 
properly syntaxing f-strings. I found out that chatgpt gave me better answers than claude. 
However this could be just a personal opinion of mine.
