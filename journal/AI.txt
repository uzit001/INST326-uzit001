Week 1

This week I used AI to the minimum since we practiced basic pyhton skills
which we should know as students but i found that for when i asked for 
examples on certains areas like properly syntaxing f-strings. I found out
that chatgpt gave me better answers than claude. However this could be 
just a personal opinion of mine. 

Week 2

This week I mostly utilized AI to aid me in debugging code. I used it to
explain errors in my code so that I can fix it. I used chatGPT and Claude, 
and I believe both give very similar replies. I havent yet formed a 
preferance between both.

Week 3

This week I observed myself using less AI. the exercises have been like 
puzzle games and intrigue me. I was able to keep my AI usage minimumum 
and even if i did use AI i utilized chatGPT just beacuse from my coding 
related searches on different platforms I have realized that GPT's 
responce works best for me. I have also built up the habit of rechecking
the responses i recieve to make sure the accuracy and completeness of 
them. I used AI to help understand the question requirements and 
intructions. Sometimes the words are little tricky or confusing so I use 
AI aid to progress in the right direction from the start. 

Week 4

This week I mainly used to AI help from chatGPT to understand the concept 
of classes and attributes and how to properly code them. Other than that
I used to help me understand intructions and requirements for some 
excercise questions. 

Week 5

This week we had our project 1 due that was creating a functions library 
for our selcted domain. I mostly utlized Claude for this project. I used 
AI to first help me undertand the project itself like requirements and 
necessary guidleines and then asked it to help me structure the project 
and create an outline for me so that I can easily track my progress. 
Whatever responses I received from Claude, I verfified them and made sure
they are correct before implementing them in my project.

Week 6

This week, I used Claude to learn and practice Python object-oriented 
programming fundamentals especially complex exercises focused on building
a library management system. I used it for implementations of various 
classes using instance methods, class methods (@classmethod), and static 
methods (@staticmethod), covering concepts like ID generation, date 
utilities, loan policies, catalog management, search filtering, 
statistical aggregation, and CSV export. This structured approach 
combined with AI help, helped me reinforce core OOP principles through 
practical, real-world scenarios.

Week 7

I worked with Claude to build a Library Management System for my Python 
class, focusing on error handling and testing. Claude helped me grasp 
concepts better annd guided me through concepts like try/except blocks, 
custom exceptions, and input validation. Together, we created functions 
for ISBN validation, date parsing, and loan tracking, plus wrote 80+ 
unit tests to ensure everything works correctly. 

Something else on the side that I would like to share is that I have 
observed myself to ask Claude from help rather than any other AI tool. I 
believe its because it helps me understand concepts and coding in easy 
terms and useful examples, which then make it easier to relate to weekly
exercises and concepts covered in lecture and discussion sessions. 


Week 8

This week I worked on inheritance and polymorphism exercises while using 
Claude as my AI assistant for developing the Library Management system. I 
utlized it for implementing subclasses for PrintedBook, EBook, AudioBook, 
<<<<<<< HEAD
and ReferenceBook with proper method overriding. I designed polymorphic fee 
calculations, member specializations, and integrated composition patterns with 
the Notifier class while using Calude to write comprehensive unit tests and 
end-to-end scenarios demonstrating polymorphic behavior. Claude also assisted 
with organizing the code structure.


Week 9

This week, I leveraged Claude to deepen my understanding of polymorphism and 
abstract classes in Python. I used Claude to explore these concepts through 
dialogue and practical examples. When I encountered confusing explanations, 
I asked Calude to reorganize and clarify the material with clear labels and 
sequential structure that matched my learning style. Overall, it helped me 
greatly in grasping new concepts. 


Week 10 

This week I used Claude in a supportive way while working through the 
Week 10 programming exercises. I completed the code myself 
and asked Claude to double-check specific parts—mainly small clarifications, 
confirming whether my implementations followed the instructions correctly, and 
identifying minor issues I might have overlooked. I used Claude like a second set 
of eyes to validate my logic and ensure consistency across the exercises. 
This helped me feel more confident in my coding decisions.

Week 12

This week has just been winding up and strengthning skills and concepts that I have 
learned through out the semester. I went over my chats with Claude and reflected on
how I utilized it this semester. As a helper. As an personal assistant. But also 
acknowledging at the same time that it does sometime come up with stuff, provide 
incorrect responses and hallucinate. I realized that AI is a great tool that helps 
students plan organize and ace their studies. And I am grateful to have a prof who 
can also improvised quickly with fast evolving tech world. I would like to conclude 
that it is good to use AI tools to assist in various tasks but understanding how 
they work and fact checking is a crucial step before incorporating any kind of AI material 
into anything.
