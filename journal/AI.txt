Week 1

This week I used AI to the minimum since we practiced basic pyhton skills which we should 
know as students but i found that for when i asked for examples on certains areas like 
properly syntaxing f-strings. I found out that chatgpt gave me better answers than claude. 
However this could be just a personal opinion of mine. 

Week 2

This week I mostly utilized AI to aid me in debugging code. I used it to explain errors in my 
code so that I can fix it. I used chatGPT and Claude, and I believe both give very similar replies. 
I havent yet formed a preferance between both.

Week 3

This week I observed myself using less AI. the exercises have been like puzzle games and 
intrigue me. I was able to keep my AI usage minimumum and even if i did use AI i utilized chatGPT 
just beacuse from my coding related searches on different platforms I have realized that GPT's 
responce works best for me. I have also built up the habit of rechecking the responses i recieve 
to make sure the accuracy and completeness of them. I used AI to help understand the question 
requirements and intructions. Sometimes the words are little tricky or confusing so I use AI aid 
to progress in the right direction from the start. 

Week 4

This week I mainly used to AI help from chatGPT to understand the concept of classes and attributes and 
how to properly code them. Other than that I used to help me understand intructions and requirements for 
some excercise questions. 

Week 5

This week we had our project 1 due that was creating a functions library for our selcted domain. I mostly 
utlized Claude for this project. I used AI to first help me undertand the project itself like requirements 
and necessary guidleines and then asked it to help me structure the project and create an outline for me so 
that I can easily track my progress. Whatever responses I received from Claude, I verfified them and made sure
they are correct before implementing them in my project.
